@article{Dredge.,
	abstract = {Digital technologies have brought significant transformation to the tourism
	
	industry, revolutionising tourism enterprises, products and experiences,
	
	business ecosystems, and destinations. Digitalisation has also transformed
	
	the traditional roles of tourism producers and consumers, with new roles,
	
	relationships, business models, and competencies emerging. The rise of
	
	digital platforms has increased the variety and volume of tourism products,
	
	services and experiences, with on-demand functionality accelerating the
	
	speed of economic transactions, market awareness and feedback. These
	
	shifts have created new opportunities, as well as challenges, for tourism SMEs
	
	as they strive to meet consumer demands, and reach new markets.
	
	Coordinated efforts to foster an innovative digital culture in tourism SMEs can
	
	ensure European destinations are globally competitive. The diversity and
	
	complexity of tourism's sub-sectors, the different challenges in urban, rural,
	
	and island destinations, and the different challenges that manifest in different
	
	institutional systems across Europe, present capacity-building and regulatory
	
	challenges for the digital tourism ecosystem.
	
	The objective of this report was to analyse the challenges and opportunities of
	
	digitalisation in tourism, how these challenges and opportunities affect
	
	different stakeholder groups, and to discuss how they might be addressed.
	
	The authors drew from a quantitative survey of 2.897 SMEs, 73 public
	
	administrations, and 85 professional associations conducted in 2016 by thirdparty consultants. This current analysis was conducted under a separate
	
	tender procedure and draws from additional secondary data sources,
	
	qualitative interviews, and scholarly research.},
